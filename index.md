## About Me


<img class="profile-picture" src="natasha_headshot_dilijan_2.png">

I am a first-year PhD Student in Geophysics at Harvard University, in the [Earthquake Seismology Group](https://quake.fas.harvard.edu/) advised by Dr. Marine Denolle. My research is supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [Harvard Ashford Fellowship](https://ashfordfellows.fas.harvard.edu/about).

## Research Interests

 My current research focuses on using ambient noise seismology to better understand and quantify ground motion amplification in sedimentary basins. I am particularly interested in how the seismic wavefield behaves at the basin edge, which I am now investigating in Seattle, especially the Seattle thrust fault, the Seattle basin's southern boundary.
